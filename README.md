My collection of guides and tools for development and things that I find interesting.  Right now it is only handling style guides, but in the future, I'd like this to be the central spot for anything that will be imported into projects.  In the off chance that you want to contribute or make changes, please continue reading.


## Developing and Contributing

PRs are welcome to adapt and fix guides.  I use hugo to manage the static site generation (it's really quite a nice tool and if you haven't tried it, I definitely recommend it).

### Steps

1. Install hugo.  [Instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) 
2. Update the appropriate markdown file.
3. Run the local server with `hugo server`.
4. Check your work.
